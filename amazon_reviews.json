As a student pursuing a career in medicine, I learned a lot from these essays. People have always said I'm diplomatic, in that I always consider the flip side of circumstances. Atul is very successful in revealing that there are always two sides to everything, and it's up to us to recognize which side is the problem and which offers a solution. He does a great job of pinpointing the issues that require further exploration, explaining what the circumstances are, and proposing possible alternatives. It's always easy to judge others from the comfort of our own homes, but Atul shows us that despite what we may assume, people are fundamentally people.

How can a doctor who is just a human be expected to be a god? Gawande looks at the profession from the mundane (hand washing) to the ethical mountain tops (physicians attending executions). The odd thing is that the death row docs have not killed nearly as many people, in the big picture, as the ones who forget to sufficiently scrub up.\n\nDr. Gawande tells us about the challenges and changes in obstetrics, cystic fibrosis, and the use of chaperones in examining rooms, trauma practice and many other little niches in the health care system from an insider's point of view.\n\nThis is a well written real life look into the daily life of a modern day physician documenting all the medical and ethical decisions that affect both the doc and the patient. He is quite frank with many of his judgment calls but never gets too technical that the book is difficult to read for the layman.

Gawande is interested in the improvement of medical practice, and he combines personal experiences and observations with a study of best practices by others. He is obviously comfortable in interviewing both patients and doctors, as well as being brilliant and an entertaining writer.\n\nAs it happens, only because his daughter urged him, he got a second opinion on her psoriasis, and it was cleared up with a common antibiotic. I am sure Gawande had researched her problem, so this illustrates the point he makes later that there is a need for more informal write-ups of things which seem to work. My daughter had a similar experience with a different problem. I was surprised to learn that he expects 2% of his surgeries to go wrong: either there will be life threatening bleeding, or collateral damage like harm to a critical nerve, or a wrong diagnosis.\n\nI enjoyed some chapters more than others, but I have no confidence my rankings will correspond to those of other readers. Anyway, I liked most the chapters on the problems in implementing better hand washing; how treatment of Iraq war wounds was dramatically improved; medical malpractice; medical care in India; and, my favorite, the chapter on the bell curve as illustrated by treatment for cystic fibrosis. I think Gawande really has something in suggesting that the U.S. handle inadvertent harm by doctors as it does harm from vaccines.

What was especially interesting to me was how this book brought to mind parallels with what seems to be a vastly different profession: software development. ALmost every chapter brought to mind a parallel. The stories of practice in rural India seemed to make a case for the value of \"generalizing specialists,\" the discussion of infection prevention was an echo of the value (and difficulty) of getting a team to be disciplined in using a few simple practices, etc. I suspect those in other fields that require individual skill, judgement, and collaboration might find the same thing. This wasn't unexpected, as I had first read The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, but that book was explicit about the parallels.

The three qualities he discusses are: diligence (giving sufficient attention to detail), to do right (questions of ethics), and ingenuity (recognizing failure and thinking anew). He demonstrates diligence by how washing hands can stop infection, a story of a massive vaccination operation to stop an outbreak of polio in India, and the saving of many wounded in Iraq by the diligent log-keeping of the medical teams to assess data and improve treatment. In discussing ethical dilemmas, Gawande says he would rather put the money he pays for malpractice insurance in a fund for patients who suffer complications from his care. He is opposed to physicians and nurses participating in executions, and since the death penalty, it seems, cannot be performed without their assurance of no pain or cruelty, then he believes the death penalty should be abolished. He also believes a doctor should never give up on a patient. His motto: Always fight. One of Gawande's examples of ingenuity is the doctors he observed in India at an institute where he spent three weeks as visiting surgeon expecting to teach. It turned out that the Indian physicians, with little equipment \"outstripped any Western surgeon I know.\" They also had great camaraderie, always taking time between cases to drink chai and swap stories about their cases.

To be sure \"Better\" gets high marks for exploring territory that the medical profession might sooner forget, even Gawande admits to his discomfort level but to suggest that the bell curve tells us \"...something unforgettable about the world outside\" is to know very little about the world outside. However, I don't want this to be about Gladwell. Gawande is a good writer. He captures the medical world, a world alien to most of us, through the eyes of a surgeon in a way that makes those who heal, those we trust and respect more than any others in society, almost human. They are just like us. As the father of a daughter who was brought into this world with a mere 23.3 weeks gestation and a zero Apgar score, who just turned 10 years old this month, I considered these healers and decided they were superhuman. They were sheltered from a world of stress, financial worry, problems with relationships, and the like. I knew I was kidding myself but I chose to believe. I knew the doctors and nurses caring for my daughter in the NICU for 87 days were on top of their game. Gawande pierces the veil and I applaud the effort to capture his thoughts. To take the time from his busy schedule to think and to consider the meaning in what he does, to improve, to get better. He has a simplistic five-step method; Ask an unscripted question, don't complain, count something, write something, and change. Simple enough, and the beauty of his formula is that it will work, and it can be applied to all aspects of life - so do as Gawande asked, heath professional or not, improve what you are and what you do. However the real message, the journey Gawande takes us on to reach his formula, is the better part of \"Better\". And since we all get sick and need the medical profession, we should all stand in the shoes of a medical professional. Gawande let's us stand in those shoes, if just for a brief moment, to glimpse a world where life and death decisions hang in the balance. Followed shortly by a life and death decision in the next examination room. Most of us will never know this kind of life. So here is my formula, first go wash your hands. Second go read this book. It will not change your life, but it will change your perspective on your next visit to the doctor's office and how you perceive the hidden world of medicine."}, "RX5T4FGEADB09": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX5T4FGEADB09/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on September 28, 2017", "text": "Good"}, "RMP5TSUHYFO1Y": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMP5TSUHYFO1Y/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on July 15, 2016", "text": "I like it a lot!

There struggle to get people to simply keep their hands clean was daunting. However it proved when you involve everyone in the solution you can more effectively fix the problem. His description of FST (Field Surgical Teams) in Iraq was eye opening. Little attention by the press was given to this handful of surgeons who saved countless soldiers and civilians lives. One of their greatest accomplishments being the tedious collection of information, which ultimately helped shape war time trauma care.

He raises procative questions.\nHe shares with us fascinating stories some that are inspiring and others that are disappointing, others controversial.

What I found most interesting was what I took as the main theme: that the practice of medicine is complex; that through attention to detail in can be systematically improved in non-obvious, pragmatic ways that are far from the big-money, high-profile research our attention is usually drawn to; and that this improvement can come from dedicated individuals and groups all over the world.\n\nEven better, some of the lessons here can carry over to other disciplines. My job has no relation to medicine but I found this book to provoke lots of ideas for my own work. Thanks, Dr. Gawande.\n\nA previous reviewer felt that the author's work was becoming \"conceited.\" I have to disagree; I found it refreshingly self-effacing.

In it, Gawande showed a deep respect and sympathy for patients while trying to be clear about what would help the medical establishment do a better job from a doctor's point of view. In this book, he covers some of the same ground but, as his title implies, here he is focused specifically on what it takes to do things better as a doctor. The chapters here are grouped under three big heading which Gawande feels are the categories of improvement: diligence, doing right, and ingenuity. Within that, he tells some fascinating stories.\n\nUnder diligence, he describes how simple persistence can improve performance significantly. For example, simple compliance with washing hands before and after each interaction with a patient would reduce unnecessary infections greatly and yet it is one of the poorest areas of performance in many medical establishment. My wife had a baby a couple weeks ago at a well-respected New York City hospital (that shall remain nameless) and, having read this book, I couldn't help but watch the hand washing. Though there was hand-washing going on, my anecdotal results were somewhat disappointing. It's scary. And yet, his stories of the effort to send polio the way of smallpox and the amazing success rates of medical teams in Iraq through no more than basic diligence with well-established methods give readers hope.\n\nUnder doing right, Gawande tells stories of the continuing debate over what constitutes right and wrong in medicine. What is the proper way to interact with someone who you have to examine naked? When is it fair to sue a doctor and how much is it worth? What should a doctor be paid for their services? Should a doctor participate in executions at prisons, considering the methods we use now are basically medical? When should a doctor continue treatment at all costs or let a patient die? These are questions with no easy answers and Gawande takes a balanced approach.\n\nUnder ingenuity, he discusses some simple, clever ideas that have helped improve performance in various areas. His wonderful chapter on childbirth focuses on the Apgar score for newborns. As most know, this is a number ubiquitous now at the birth of a baby. It wasn't even developed by an OB/GYN. It was developed by an anaesthesiologist. It required no new medical techniques. It simply required doctors and nurses to do a directed assessment of a baby at birth. And yet, this simple, ingenious change, dropped child mortality rates significantly as babies previously thought to have no chance were given a chance and hospitals competed to \"improve\" their Apgar scores. In this section he also has a discussion on how true analysis of doctor and hospital performance is rare but, when used, greatly improves success as well as a discussion of the amazing cleverness of doctors in the poorest parts of the world to do procedures with limited equipment. It was incredibly eye-opening.\n\nIt is a fact of life that all of us will have to encounter the medical establishment from time to time. It can be incredibly frustrating. Still, it's nice to know that there are doctors like Gawande trying to understand things and make them better. In addition, he is a fine writer who has a wealth of interesting history and personal anecdotes that help make his ideas clear. Everyone should take some time and read his work."}, "RXON3N1W5KFN8": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXON3N1W5KFN8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on December 2, 2017", "text": "This is a brilliant book, really an essay on the vital importance of creative thinking and perseverance.

Yes, hand washing! As an obsessive hand washer myself, I found the statistics regarding health care professionals and hand washing to be astonishing! And in the face of overwhelming evidence favoring hand washing, its pretty amazing that everyone is not donning exam gloves for everyday tasks. On the contrary, the cavalier attitude demonstrated by doctors and nurses towards hand washing would make a great psychology study. But luckily for us, there are people out there that not only appreciate the value of frequent washing, but took the extra step to figure out how to make it happen.\nI must apologize for not making this sound more interesting, because it truly is.\nWhile I found every chapter fascinating, I was particularly intrigued by the study of cystic fibrosis centers, and the description of medical care in India. In each chapter, we meet people who use their knowledge and skills to BE better.\nI especially appreciate Gawande's advice on becoming better, a 5 step program for improvement, or how to be a positive deviant. 1. Ask an unscripted question. 2. Don't complain. 3. Count something. 4. Write something. 5. Change.\nWhen are our efforts enough? Why do we always have to be better?

These and other chapters are tied together by the quest for improvement of outcomes.\n\nThe afterword encapsulates Dr. Gawande's advice to medical students on making a difference in people's lives, and it alone is worth the price of the book. \"It often seems safest to do what everyone else is doing ...\" he writes in closing. \"But a doctor must not let that happen--nor should anyone who takes on risk and responsibility in society.\"\n\nAltogether this is an informative and thought-provoking book with lessons that go beyond the specifics of medical practice.\n\nLinda Bulger, 2008"}, "R1G5AV8V01FMFN": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G5AV8V01FMFN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on August 30, 2017", "text": "Really fascinating book.

Gawande then uses examples to illustrate each topic.\n\nDiligence: Hospital infection control efforts have long identified increased hand-washing as essential - yet, studies continually report alarmingly low rates of compliance. Examples demonstrate that making this easier, searching out best practices, and sustainment efforts are key to significant improvement. Polio eradication is the subject of Gawande's second example - the follow-up response to a case in India, involving vaccinating 4 of the target 4.2 million with 37,000 vaccinators in four days, and requiring effective ice, vaccine and personnel distribution, as well as follow-up. Then it's on to the U.S. Army's efforts to reduce Iraqi war death rates - data-analysis and follow-up (eg. WEAR those Kevlar vests, changes in treatment), placement of forward operating teams (operations limited to about 3 hours) backed up by four mobile hospitals (up to 3 days care) and level IV hospitals (up to 30 days care in Germany and Spain, backed up by Walter Reed - the average time from injury to the U.S. has dropped to less than four days (from 45 in Vietnam), and the death rate has dropped to 10% (24% in Vietnam).\n\nDoing Right: Here Gawande summarizes the difficulty of health-care professionals \"knowing when to quit\" (do no more for a patient), the moral dilemma of assisting executions, and problems determining how much to pay physicians (paid about 7X that of the average U.S. worker, vs. 3X in the rest of the world).\n\nInquisitiveness: Gawande saves the best for last, beginning by citing problems in childbirth and the difficulty training new doctors in the art of forceps use (correct pressure, pulling strength, choice of forceps, placement). Then its on to cystic fibrosis. Here we learn of Dr. Berwick's efforts to improve quality (offers funds - IF recipient centers share their data and methods with others, AND discuss improvement plans with patients. Discussion with a resident afflicted with CF elicits the conclusion that better use of existing knowledge is more important at this time than more research (eg. genetics). Similarly, we learn how rural Indian doctors improvise - thus, basic tools and cleanliness are likelihood to offer greater improvement there than the latest U.S. technology.\n\nGawande's Recommendations for Physicians: 1)Don't complain, ask questions (include getting input from technicians, LPNs, etc.), quantify outcomes, write so others can learn, and look for opportunity to change to improved methods."}, "R16MMHYVRN0PK1": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16MMHYVRN0PK1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on December 15, 2014", "text": "Worthwhile read on how to improve our thinking and processes, even if it means acknowledging that we're imperfect.

He states that approximately two million Americans pick up an infection while in the hospital. Of these, ninety thousand will die from that same infection. Possible attacks come from rotavirus, Norwalk virus, Pseudomonas bacteria, resistant Klebsiella, MRSA-- methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and VRE-- vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus--the last two frequently causing pneumonias, wound and bloodstream infections.\n\nAdmittedly, Dr. Gawande recognizes that studies show nurses and doctors do not wash their hands frequently enough, up to 50% of the time. Recalling the lesson taught by obstetrician Ignac Semmelweis, he points out the cause of childbed fever (puerperal fever) was the lack of washing hands. In 1847, 600 of 3,000 mothers delivering babies in Semmelweis's Viennese hospital, died from the bacteria Streptococcus, which leads to childbed fever. After instigating a wash up with chlorine and a nail brush for doctors and nurses, between patients, the death rate fell from 20% to 1%. Even though this procedure offered sufficient proof of success, doctors elsewhere declined to institute the hand washing. They simply could not believe that they themselves were making their patients sick.\n\nRecently, a surgeon named Jon Lloyd hit on an idea from the Save the Children program: Positive Defiance, or building upon capabilities people already have, rather than making them change their behaviors. After meeting with small groups (from kitchen worker and janitor to nurses, doctors, and even patients) in a trial Pittsburgh hospital, and instilling the staff's ideas, change was made. For example, they themselves decided where to best place new hand-gel dispensers. By empowering the employees, they worked together toward a common goal. The result at the end of one year, \"the entire hospital saw its MRSA wound infection rates drop to zero.\"\n\nDr. Gawande continues with news that The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Jewish Healthcare Foundation are beginning to implement this initiative in ten more hospitals across the United States.

In the past couple of years, I have seen three new doctors and been in two hospital emergency rooms: all the doctors produced grossly erroneous records via their computers as did one of the hospitals, errors which took me many months of effort to partially correct (some errors could not, or would not, be corrected and remain to mislead future caregivers).

If this new book, \"Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance,\" is a representative example of his usual writing talent, I will completely agree with the above assessment. This collection of original and previously published essays is highly readable and very interesting. Normally, I am not all that interested in reading about medical topics unless it impacts me personally. I'm not a great fan of hospitals nor am I enthusiastic about going to a physician. Fortunately, for most of my life I have enjoyed relatively excellent health. My attitude, however, changed five years ago and Gawande's book takes on some genuine relevance for me. How so and why?\n\nIn a section of his book, entitled \"The Mop-Up,\" Gawande discusses polio and the campaign to wipe it out in Asia wherein he was a momentary observer in the field in 2003. Way back in ancient history, when I was a mere child in the 1940s and America was hit with a polio epidemic, I was diagnosed with polio and almost died. Hence the relevance here for me. But more than that, I am convinced to this day that I was \"saved\" because of the efforts of a nurse -- I'm sure she was one of Gawande's \"positive deviants\" which he describes in his book -- who insisted on treating me and others with a controversial treatment (opposed by most of the medical \"establishment\" at the time) called \"The Sister Kenny Method.\" She never lost a patient, by the way; we all recovered without any significant aftereffects that I know of.\n\nFortunately, from that time in the 1940s I never needed to be hospitalized again. That is, until 2002. Then I had a heart attack and was forced into a hospital for an angioplasty and had to take note of medical matters, including the state of medical care in this country.\" So, whereas before that latter year I could ignore books of the type that Gawande writes, I now have a profound interest in all things medical. Even more so since my second heart attack and angioplasty in 2006. (I even subscribe to daily updates via e-mail about medical topics!) I am now very concerned about \"better\" when it comes to medical care and policy.\n\nGawande divides his book into three significant sections: Diligence, Doing Right, and Ingenuity. He says that \"Diligence\" is \"the necessity of giving sufficient attention to detail to avoid error and prevail against obstacles.\" The section \"Doing Right\" considers topics such as \"how much doctors should be paid, and what we owe patients when we make mistakes.\" Important as these sections are, the final section, \"Ingenuity,\" is of even greater importance in my opinion. Ingenuity, he says, \"demands more than anything a willingness to recognize failure\" and \"arises from deliberate, even obsessive, reflection on failure and a constant searching for new solutions.\" Amen to that!\n\nFurthermore, Gawande quite realistically concludes: \"Betterment is a perpetual labor. The world is chaotic, disorganized, and vexing, and medicine is nowhere spared that reality. To complicate matters, we in medicine are also only human ourselves. ...Yet...to live as a doctor is to live so that one's life is bound up in others' and in science and in the messy, complicated connection between the two. It is to live a life of responsibility. The question...is not whether one accepts the responsibility. Just by doing this work one has. The question is, having accepted the responsibility, how one does such work well.\" Well said, that. Couldn't agree more.\n\nOne of the more politically relevant issues (at least for me) that Gawande discusses is the matter of medical practitioners' involvement in executions. In his essay, \"The Doctors of the Death Chamber,\" he says that \"We [doctors and nurses] must do our best to choose intelligently and wisely,\" and then notes that \"Sometimes, however, we will be wrong -- as I think the doctors and nurses are who have used their privileged skills to make possible 876 deaths by lethal injection thus far.\" I cannot understand how a physician -- \"First, do no harm\" -- could even contemplate participating in the killing of another human being, even if officially sanctioned. Gawande addresses this issue in what I think is a sensible manner. But the debate on this issue is current, lively and will continue for some time.\n\nI do, however, wish that Gawande had spent more time discussing the future of health care in America as regards the delivery of medical services to all its citizens. He briefly touches on this matter, but not in detail. From my perspective, HMOs are definitely not the solution (they are part of the current problem!) and government-managed health care (socialized medicine) is even less desirable. I mean, the government, in my opinion, cannot even provide a decent public education for our children; how can we expect it to provide decent health care? I have considered a number of proposals, all of them wanting in some way or other. I'd like to see Gawande tackle this problem in a detailed way from a physician's perspective. Maybe another book?\n\nMoreover, regarding the above, it is disturbing to read what one American medical reviewer recently stated: \"We spend 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country, for a total of $2 trillion a year, yet our health system, according to the World Health Organization, ranks 37th worldwide. ...By any measure -- longevity, infant mortality, burden of disease -- we sit in the basement of the industrialized world.\" For a country that can spend trillions of dollars to wage war and promote \"regime changes\" throughout the world, that statement is embarrassing and hard to fathom.\n\nAll in all, \"Better\" is a good read and extremely informative. It is full of interesting anecdotes, as well as confronting, if only briefly, some of the major issues in the practice of medicine today such as the influence of money in the healthcare system, the problem of malpractice lawsuits, and medical practice under the tensions of the military battlefield, as well as more mundane issues which are often ignored such as the simple act of hand washing or how nakedness impacts the examination room. Since I have had my own experiences lately with the medical establishment, I can now relate to at least some of the topics that Gawande discusses. Therefore -- and since there is no medical experience like a really personal one -- I highly recommend this book to all readers. I guarantee you'll learn a lot, you'll enjoy the fine writing, and you'll have some thinking to do about the state of medical care in America."}, "R2M4A2BPPZJ3XY": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M4A2BPPZJ3XY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on April 26, 2017", "text": "This is a great book that I recommend for anyone, especially those in the medical field."}, "R19UXSD9EWB1LX": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19UXSD9EWB1LX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on August 9, 2011", "text": "Recently, I read Atul Gawande's third book, \"The Checklist Manifesto,\" and I was SO impressed with the book...the content and his wonderful writing style, that I devoured his other two books: \"Complications,\" (his first book while he was still a medical resident) and \"Better: A surgeon's notes on performance.\"\n\nI sent out an email to everyone I knew about his books and told them that every once in a while an author write something really IMPORTANT.

Dr. Atul Gawande, a general surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital and staff writer for the New Yorker has keen observation and insight to make single stories demonstrate not only the failings of our healthcare system but also the solutions to them because of individuals asking questions on how to do better. Ultimately, one of the questions he asks is how can doctors and hospitals be positive deviants? How does one become a positive deviant or an outlier that pushes beyond convention and advances patient care to new levels?\n\nHe gives examples of how over four million children need to be vaccinated in Northern/Southern India in three days to prevent a large polio outbreak. An immunization rate of less than 90 percent would be considered a failure.\n\nDr. Gawande talked about the evolution of obstetrics. After a damaging report in 1933, the specialty consequently committed itself to standardizing childbirth ensuring that with the new medical knowledge that it was applied consistently and routinely throughout the country. As a result maternal death in childbirth fell 90 percent from one in 150 in the 1930s to one in 2000 by 1950s. With continued innovations and the commitment to do better, the chance of a woman dying in childbirth is less than one in 10,000 today.\n\nThere are plenty of amazing examples that you don't have to be a doctor to relate on how truly inspirational these individuals are in times when the stakes could not be higher - life or death.\n\nAs a practicing family doctor, I believe that our healthcare system can do better in providing all of us the best care consistently and routinely across the country. Although his book is easily a classic and should be required reading for all future doctors, sadly I think true healthcare reform and improvement are years away. I wrote the book Stay Healthy, Live Longer, Spend Wisely: Making Intelligent Choices in America's Healthcare System specifically so everyone has the information they need to get the best care today. Until our healthcare system improves to its full potential as Dr. Gawande challenges us to do, unfortunately will always remain benefiting those who are insiders and harming those who are not.

That's because the author sets out to answer a question that is as important for people in business as it is for people in medicine.\n\nWhat does it take to be good at something when it is so easy not to be?\n\nGawande ways that most people, especially physicians, think that success in medicine comes from canny diagnosis, technical prowess and the ability to empathize. They think that progress in medicine comes from scientific breakthroughs and sophisticated equipment and procedures.\n\nThe reality, though, is quote different. Improved performance, according to Gawande, comes from\n\nDiligence\nDoing Right\nIngenuity\n\nAgain and again Gawande demonstrates how concentrating on patients and on performance leads to improvement for both individuals and for medical practice in general. He does this with a mix of historical examples, patient stories, statistics and stories from his own life and practice.\n\nHe divides the book into three sections corresponding to his three necessities for improvement.\n\nIn the section on Diligence the chapters are on washing hands, dealing with polio in India, and dealing with casualties from the Iraq war. The chapter on military medicine and the concentration on process improvement is worth the price of the book if you're in business. One of the most powerful lessons of this book is that process improvements can lead to dramatic improvements in performance.\n\nThe section on Doing Right deals with ethical issues that physicians face. The chapters are on medical malpractice, whether and how physicians should be involved in executions, when a physician should fight to keep a patient alive, and the problems and dilemmas of how the business side of medicine affects how medicine is practiced.\n\nThe central messages of this section are that \"Choices must be made. No choice will always be right. There are ways to make our choices better.\" How to learn about making better choices is the subject of the third and final section of the book.\n\nIn Ingenuity or \"thinking anew,\" Gawande covers measuring the comparative effectiveness of physicians and medical centers, relative and absolute measures of performance, the practice of obstetrics as a model of change, and how physicians in less developed countries get by without the technology and facilities that are characteristic of US medicine.\n\nThis section is about how to do better. You can sum it up this way: there is a bell curve in almost all human activities with huge variations in performance between the best and those in the middle of the pack. Measuring results is the way to get results that matter.\n\nThis book is about the practice of medicine but it's also about getting better at whatever it is that you do. Gawande's message is that \"better is possible.\" It requires diligence and moral clarity, the willingness to try and measure outcomes, and the discipline to change what you do based on the results you get."}, "R19GTBB7U4G4B1": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19GTBB7U4G4B1/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on May 1, 2008", "text": "Atul Gawande, in \"Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance,\" asks, \"What does it take to be good at something in which failure is so easy?\" When someone's well-being is at stake, is mere competence enough? The author maintains that a great deal more is needed \"to enable every human being to lead a life as long and free of frailty as science will allow.\" With so much on the line, knowledge is not enough. To do their best, doctors should be conscientious, technically proficient, morally scrupulous, resourceful, and compassionate. The author examines \"three core requirements for success in medicine\": diligence (attention to detail and avoidance of errors), \"to do right,\" and ingenuity (\"thinking anew\"). Is a doctor willing to look at a difficult situation in a new light? Can she confront her failures, learn from them, and change? Dr. Gawande presents specific examples of medical professionals meeting a variety of challenges and, in the process, transforming medical care and saving lives.\n\nIn this elegantly written book, the author makes the abstract real. He does not merely focus on dramatic events; he also demonstrates how the seemingly mundane can be crucial. One example centers on infection control. Deborah Yokoe, an infectious disease specialist and Susan Marino, a microbiologist, have done their utmost to reduce the spread of infection in their Boston-based hospital. Two million Americans acquire infections every year during their hospital stays and thousands die as a result. One way to cut down on infection in hospitals is for clinicians to carefully and consistently wash their hands. Yokoe and Marino have tried everything to get doctors and nurses to wash. They have posted warning signs, installed new sinks in convenient locations, given rewards to the units with the best rates of compliance, and even issued hygiene report cards. Nothing has worked. Doctors and nurses simply do not take the time to wash their hands as much as they should. As a result, the rates of infection in the hospital remain higher than they should be.\n\nTwo other individuals in Pennsylvania, however, came up with innovations that actually made a difference. Peter Perreiah, an industrial engineer, devised an ingenious system that made each hospital room function like a mini-operating room. Jon Lloyd, a surgeon and colleague of Perreiah, promoted the idea of \"positive deviance--the idea of building on capabilities people already had rather than telling them how they had to change.\" By inviting the staff to come up with their own solutions rather than imposing rules from above, \"the norms began to shift.\" One year into the experiment, infection rates dropped precipitously.\n\nGawande demonstrates time and again that when people rack their brains to come up with answers, they can solve seemingly intractable medical problems. The author's account of the Herculean efforts expended to eradicate polio in India and to save the lives of wounded soldiers in Iraq are fascinating and impressive. Equally engrossing are the sections dealing with best practices in obstetrics and effective treatments for cystic fibrosis. Dr. Gawande's remarks concerning how far physicians should go to keep their patients alive raise intriguing questions without offering facile answers. \"In the face of uncertainty, wisdom is to err on the side of pushing, to not give up. But you have to be ready to recognize when pushing is only ego....You have to be ready to recognize when the pushing can turn to harm.\" The author believes that medical decisions should always be based on the best interests of the patient, and fruitless suffering should be avoided. This is a tough call and wise doctors will not hesitate to consult with their colleagues to get other opinions. My one quibble is that Gawande's segments focusing on doctors' income, malpractice, and the ethics of physician-assisted executions do not fit comfortably in a work about enhancing medical performance.\n\nThe bottom line is that \"arriving at meaningful solutions is an inevitably slow and difficult process.\" Common to all successful initiatives is the willingness to face challenges with a determination to do whatever it takes to find remedies. Atul Gawande is a thoughtful and intelligent writer; his graceful prose makes \"Better\" an absolute pleasure to read.

But my sister gave me two of Gawande's works, and after reading the first (Complications), I was hooked. Better is a book that focuses on improvement, on moving forward, and how best to do it. As someone in the medical world, I found it very interesting and applicable to my work. But Gawande gives examples and suggestions that can apply to everyone in any field or life-stage. His use of real-life case studies makes the possibly dry topic of improvement actually engaging. He writes using interesting case studies to demonstrate his points, including: infections and handwashing, vaccinations in the third world, military medical care in the field, ethical decisions and malpractice, cystic fibrosis, and childbirth... to mention a few. He advocates being open to change, always looking for areas in which you can grow and improve in your practice and as a human being. For example, one point that has really stuck with me since reading this is his section on \"diligence\". In my profession as a nurse, there are many little seemingly minor actions and procedures that we must follow a million times a day. But every little action contributes to the well-being of my patients, I must be diligent in my practice. I also must be diligent in my life, to work hard to accomplish the tasks I have undertaken, to be persistent. Gawande has seen and learned so much, through his writing I feel that he must be one of the most interesting men alive. The book really is not so much about only improving the medical practice, but improving as humans. Gawande has a great deal of insight to offer, and I would happily give either of his books to any friend of mine, regardless of their interest in medical affairs/cases. I think we can all find something to learn from in his works."}, "R2P2GPSOSFMYNU": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P2GPSOSFMYNU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on November 9, 2007", "text": "What can medicine do to improve the quality of patient care around the world? That is, at its heart, the question that author Atul Gawande throws at readers and practitioners alike. \"We can do better,\" he tells us, and thus begat the title: BETTER.\n\nHaving thoroughly enjoyed Complications, I decided to check out Dr. Gawande's other writings and was pleasantly surprised to find this collection of stories. Although both Complications and Better are short story compilations, Complications lacked cohesiveness whereas Better had no such problems.\n\nLeading us down simple and often shocking paths, Gawande gives us complicated facts but in laymen's terms. The simplest would be his chapter on hand washing, and how effective it can be for preventing the spread of infection, especially such newly dangerous things as MRSA, an antibiotic resistant bacterial strain that is killing hospital patients far too often. The ease with which its spread is preventable is as simple as a hand cleanser, yet getting doctors (and other medical staff) to do this is nearly impossible. \"We can do better.\"\n\nThe beleaguered medical malpractice insurance requirements that plague every doctors pocketbook is hit hard upon, including a look at why it is necessary and why the system is headed for deep trouble. \"We can do better.\"\n\nProbably the most telling chapters were directed at Dr. Gawande's return to India (his national homeland). Polio is on the run and is nearly extinct as a disease. Yet in small Indian provinces, occasional \"hot spots\" flare up and a band of less than 10 medical men and women must vaccinate over 4 million children in less than two weeks. And they do it. Gawande tells us if this is possible, can't the U.S. do better at fighting infection? The other striking aspect is how India's doctors often work with substandard supplies (or minimal) on dangerous cases. Or perform a surgery they've never done before or are ill equipped to handle. But handle it they do. One such case involved a boy with hydrocephalus (\"water on the brain\" caused by a build up of cerebral spinal fluid). No physicians at the hospital Gawande visited had ever done a shunt, the procedure necessary to relieve the pressure. But they eventually do a makeshift surgery that saves the boys life \"using about as few supplies as I'd use for a suture repair.\" Quite an eye-opener. \"We can do better.\"\n\nThe chapters on CF (cystic fibrosis) are exceptionally well rendered as we learn that doing better at one thing can have huge benefits. When physicians focus all of their talents on cystic fibrosis, the result was astounding. Life expectancy for CF patients jumped from 17 years of age to over 40. And now it looks like they may very well be able to live into the 70s. It isn't some new super-drug that's extending these peoples lives, but looking at the disease process in terms of better treatment strategies; living proof that doing \"Better\" can help medicine achieve miraculous results.\n\nAtul Gawande is to be commended for writing a book that flays open the medical system and exposes the diseases beneath; diseases that we can do better at."}, "R1HW4ZDS06B82": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HW4ZDS06B82/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805082115", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on September 27, 2010", "text": "In the book, 'Better,' Atul Gawande, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, offers five suggestions for \"becoming a positive deviant.\"\n\nAsk an Unscripted Question\nDon't Complain\nCount Something\nWrite Something, and\nChange\n\nOf these five, my favorite is Count Something.

I have been meaning to read and review his book for many years. What a fitting introduction to \u2018The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.\u2019\nPhilosophers Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre tackled the issue of why we fail at what we set out to do in the world. One reason, they explain is \u201cnecessary fallibility\u201d, a consequence of some things in the world, and our lives, being beyond our understanding and control.\nBut there is much that is not, and yet we fail at these too. Gorovitz and MacIntyre suggest that there are two reasons for this: ignorance and ineptitude (incompetence or clumsiness.)\nFor most of human history, people\u2019s lives have been lived largely in ignorance. However, over the last few decades, science has filled in enough knowledge to make our \u2018ineptitude\u2019 as much of a challenge as our \u2018ignorance\u2019 was in the past.\nGawande\u2019s context is the ineptitude in medicine. While our knowledge and sophistication has grown enormously, the struggle is still how to deliver on this know-how.\nThe knowing-doing gap is found everywhere. From the frequent mistakes authorities make when disaster strikes, to the legal mistakes our lawyers make that are the result of little more than simple administrative errors.\n\u201cEvery day there is more and more to manage and get right and learn,\u201d Gawande points out. With all we are required to manage, failure happens far more often - despite great effort rather than from a lack of it.\nExpertise has been seen as the solution to ineptitude in most areas of work \u2013 \u201cthey need more training!\u201d and modern medicine has been no different. But capability clearly isn\u2019t our primary difficulty; in most fields training is longer and more intense than ever. In the early twentieth century, you could practice medicine with only a high school diploma and a one-year medical degree. Today doctors have six years of university, and three to seven years of residency to practice paediatrics, surgery, neurology, or the like.\nYet our failures remain frequent, but there is a solution \u2013 checklists.\nThough this seems almost ridiculous in its simplicity - especially to those of us who have spent years carefully developing ever more advanced skills - it has proven not to be.\nIn 1935 the US Army was looking for the next generation long-range bomber. Boeing\u2019s aluminium-alloy Model 299 was able to carry five times as many bombs as the army had requested, and could fly faster and farther than previous bombers. The army planned to order at least 65 planes until it stalled on a test flight, turned on one wing, and exploded. The crash, attributed to \u2018pilot error, killed 2 of the 5 crew members. This prompted Boeing to come up with an ingeniously simple approach: they created a pilot\u2019s checklist. It is worth noting that using a checklist for takeoff was about as odd as using a checklist to back out of your garage.\nHowever, flying this new plane was too complicated to be left to the memory of any person, no matter how expert. The test pilots made checklists for takeoff, flight, landing, and taxiing, and armed with the checklist, flew a total of 1.8 million miles without one accident. The army ultimately ordered almost 13,000 planes.\nLike flying, many areas of our lives and work have become \u201ctoo much airplane for one person to fly.\u201d\nFaulty memory and distraction are a constant danger in \u201call-or-none processes\u201d like going to the shop to buy ingredients for a cake, piloting a plane through a takeoff, or treating a sick person in the hospital. \u201cIf you miss just one key thing, you might as well not have made the effort at all,\u201d says Gawande.\nAnother human danger you may well recognize, is allowing yourself to skip steps even when you remember them. You skip steps because it has never been a problem before \u2013 until one day it is.\nChecklists can provide protection against such lapses, as they remind us of the minimum necessary steps.\nProfessors Zimmerman and Glouberman distinguish between 3 different kinds of problems: the simple, the complicated, and the complex.\n\u2018Simple problems\u2019 are ones like baking a cake from a recipe with a few basic techniques you need to learn. Master them and you most likely will have success.\n\u2018Complicated problems\u2019 are like sending a rocket to the moon. There is no straightforward recipe, and success usually requires many people and great expertise. Unanticipated problems are common, and timing and coordination become serious concerns.\n\u2018Complex problems\u2019 are like raising a child. You can\u2019t repeat and perfect the process as you can with rockets. Every child is unique, and while expertise is valuable, it is not sufficient. The outcome remains highly uncertain.\nThe value of checklists for simple problems is self-evident: that is why we have a shopping list. But much of the most critical work people do, is not simple. Checklists help prevent failure especially when the problems combine everything from the simple to the complex.\nThe real value of checklists is in conditions of true complexity, where the knowledge requirements exceed that of any individual, and unpredictability reigns. Commands and control from the centre will fail. Under these conditions, not only are checklists a help, they are essential for success. In these complex situations where individuals must exercise their own judgement, this judgement will be enhanced by checklist procedures.\n\nBad checklists are vague and imprecise, too long and hard to use. They are written as if the people using them are stupid, and they try to spell out every single step. Good checklists, are precise and begin with the premise that a checklist cannot fly a plane. That is why, faced with catastrophe, pilots are astonishingly willing to turn to their checklists.\nChecklists come in two forms: DO-CONFIRM and READ-DO. Using a DO-CONFIRM checklist, people do jobs from memory and experience, then stop and check. Using a READ-DO checklist, people carry out the tasks as they check them off, like a recipe.\nTo get value from checklists, they must make sense for the particular situation. A rule-of-thumb is to keep it to between five and nine items, simply worded, and exact.\nDoes this work? This was rigorously tested in the World Health Organization\u2019s \u2018safe surgery\u2019 research across a variety of hospitals of different sizes, rich and poor, in countries from Tanzania to the US. In this carefully constructed study, a 2-minute, 19 step surgery checklist, resulted in an immediate drop in infection and mortality in thousands of operations in 8 participating hospitals. Major complications dropped 36%, and deaths fell by 47%.\nThat is how much a checklist can add to the skills of highly trained, highly skilled surgeons. It is worth a serious try in your business. You will get startling results too.\nReadability Light ---+- Serious\nInsights High +---- Low\nPractical High +---- Low\n\n*Ian Mann of Gateways consults internationally on leadership and strategy, and is the author of the recently released Executive"}, "R2VF88OFXOG48M": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VF88OFXOG48M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on December 28, 2014", "text": "Checklist Manifesto reads like a very good long form blog post that got stretched into a book.

Even more, a thoughtful checklist can serve as a way to bridge disciplines to allow practitioners to work together who might otherwise not have found a common language. One hopes that the concept and practice of checklists will be adopted across many disciplines."}, "R3IQ491TIFJD6M": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IQ491TIFJD6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on February 7, 2013", "text": "Atul Gawande is a physician interested in improving surgical practice. He reviews surgical cases with disastrous outcomes that could have been prevented and cites research claiming that nearly half of deaths that occur in surgery are in fact preventable. We read a detailed analysis of a drowning accident in which the young victim's life was saved against all odds. Why? Because the hospital staff had discussed and practiced the procedures to treat cold-water drowning ahead of time. They used no new knowledge; they just coordinated and communicated more effectively.\n\nGawande examines how human beings do things. There are two reasons we fail at complex tasks. The first is ignorance. We correct it by conducting research and building schools to increase our knowledge. The second and more common reason for failure is ineptitude--the right knowledge is available, but we do not apply it correctly. People continually forget, are distracted, or skip steps because they seem unimportant. This problem lurks below the radar; we don't recognize it, let alone try to solve it. Instead we send people off for more training to increase their knowledge.\n\nWhat is needed instead is a simple way to remind people of what they know at the right time to make a difference. We have an answer, we just aren't using it. \"Checklists seem to provide protection against such failures. They remind us of the minimum necessary steps and make them explicit. They not only offer the possibility of verification, but also instill a kind of discipline of higher performance.\"\n\nThe author examines checklists used by airline pilots, building contractors, investors and other physicians. In these professions work has become too complex for even a talented individual to perform alone. Teams of skilled experts must manage both communication and complexity to succeed. They do both with checklists. These checklists make people stop and think at \"pause points\" to ensure that the right things have been done. They get coworkers to bond as a team by requiring them to talk to each other. As a result, people become comfortable enough to speak up when they see a potential problem.\n\nChapter Six, The Checklist Factory is the instructional meat of the book, with recommendations that help us develop good checklists. There are direct guidelines about brevity and clarity. There are also process guidelines about identifying common mistakes and fine-tuning a checklist with field testing. He distinguishes between READ-DO checklists, which march novices through the tightly specified steps of rote tasks, and DO-CONFIRM checklists, which provide checkpoints for experienced professionals solving complex problems in coordinated groups. Both have their place, but DO-CONFIRM checklists have the most potential to make a difference.\n\nThere are barriers to checklist use. They have a serious user acceptance problem. Many accomplished professionals consider themselves virtuosos who don't need help from other people at all, let alone somebody else's checklist. To many others checklists seem too mundane to make a difference. The author works hard to persuade us. His own research on checklists in operating rooms finds significant drops in death rates, post-operative infections, and other outcome measures. He highlights successes at prominent hospitals to encourage wider acceptance, asks administrators to impose requirements, and calls on nurses to help change the culture of the operating room. The idea is slowly catching on.\n\nGawande wishes we would move more quickly. \"In the money business everyone looks for an edge. If someone is doing well, people pounce like starved hyenas to find out how. Almost every idea for making even slightly more money ... gets sucked up by the giant maw almost instantly. Every idea, that is except one: checklists.\"\n\nI learned some things from this book and highly recommend it. Give it at least a quick look, starting with Chapter 6.

When everyone thinks someone must have done something already, it's easy to imagine that this something could have been forgotten!\n\nA second purpose of checklists is to build a team spirit. By assigning the checklist to a specific person and having different tasks verified by different members of the team, the resulting communications invariably lead to more information being shared among the entire team.\n\nWhat makes the book great is the emphasis it places on the importance of designing the checklist. Even experts will need several attempts before they get their checklist right. Further, proven and tested checklists are not static boilerplate templates. Each organization needs to tweak its checklists to fit its culture. Checklist are not exhaustive itemized procedures.\n\nSome people complain the book is padded while others complain that it is too narrow. It is neither.\n\nIt's about the importance and benefits of checklists in general, it's about how they first appeared in aviation before spreading to other fields, and it's about the difficulty of getting them accepted by the people who should use them.\n\nGawande says a lot in a short space; any reader will get his full message in the two hours it takes to read the book. Hardly the stuff of padding.\n\nNor is the book focused on the medical industry. Because the author is a surgeon, he naturally illustrates his general idea with examples from medecine. Given the egos doctors have and the importance of meticulousness in surgery, this make medecine a particularly good field from which to illustrate the contribution checklists can make and the difficulties of getting them accepted.\n\nSo what if Gawande doesn't mention other industries?

Yet, despite demonstrating that checklists produce results, there is resistance to their use because of the (1) Master of Universe mentality (Rock Star; Fighter Pilot; Hero), (2) our jobs are too complex to reduce to a checklist, (3) checklists are too rigid and don't force us to look up and see and think ahead of what's in front of us. Yet, in a complex environment, he states that experts are up against 2 difficulties - the fallibility of human memory when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events and secondly, people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them - after all certain steps don't always matter...until one day they do. Gawande makes a persuasive case in his book as to why you should develop and implement a process checklist for critical processes/decisions.\n\n* Whether you are from the medical field or not, you will benefit from the inspiring thinking and insights.\n\n* This book is game changing - a call-to-action for generating better results despite the pull to run with intuition or gut instinct. If you are implementing via intuition rather than a systematic process, this book's message will force you to pause in your tracks to seek a more disciplined approach.\n\n* The author uses a wide range of industries to make his case using an engaging blend of anecdotes, storytelling and research - from healthcare to aviation (US Airways 1549 landing in Hudson River) - - to high-end award winning restaurants - - to building massive office skyscrapers and shopping centers - -to setting up a Van Halen rock concert - - to FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans - - to money managers making investment selections.\n\n* Can be read in 1-2 sittings. Page Turner. Fully engaging and riveting until the last page is turned.\n\n* Author's determination, authenticity, inspired thinking, modesty and willingness to disclose personal mistakes makes this an inspirational book. Both brilliantly written and a pleasure to read.\n\nMy favorite excerpts:\n\n\"Despite showing (hospital) staff members of the benefits of using the checklist, 20% resisted stating that it was not easy to use, it took too long and felt it had not improved the safety of care. Yet, when asked an additional question - would you want the checklist to be used if you were having an operation - a full 93% said yes.\"\n\n\"In a world in which success now requires large enterprises, teams of clinicians, high-risk technologies, and knowledge that outstrips any one person's abilities, individual autonomy hardly seems the ideal we should aim for. ..what is needed, however is discipline...discipline is hard - harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures. We can't even keep from snacking between meals. We are built for novelty and excitement, not for careful attention to detail. Discipline is something we have to work at.\"\n\n\"We don't study routine failures...when we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination. We know the patterns. We see the costs. It's time to try something else. Try a checklist.\"\n\n\"We're obsessed in medicine with having great components, the best drugs, the best devices, the best specialists - but pay little attention to how to make them fit together well\"\"\n\n\"It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment. It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us - those we aspire to be - handle situations of high stakes and complexity. The truly great are daring. They improvise. They do not have protocols and checklists. Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.\""}, "R2FYHSQG9X2PYZ": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FYHSQG9X2PYZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on April 9, 2014", "text": "Besides being well-written, with numerous examples that kept my interest, Gawande makes the point that we are all fallible, but don't like to admit it.

It felt like I was listening to his story while watching an animation of his events - that shows just how vivid his imagery is, or perhaps it's just how I read books.\n\nI was fascinated at the various facts that the author brought up regarding checklists, and the immense amount of positive change they have brought about. For example, it was fascinating to read about the B2 bombers and how the pilots used checklists in order to get everything right and thus were capable of flying the plane, and to his study at the end of the book and the remarkable results from that. It's been a while since I completed the book, so I apologize for any discrepancies between this review and the book.\n\nI was, however, mildly altered after reading this book. This book showed us the significance of stopping and having reminders of what to do next - a checklist. Somewhat ironically, I began using checklists too [I'm a rather scatterbrained person and could never maintain a checklist - I would write one out and never use it again, or perhaps I wouldn't even finish the checklist]. I have found that they are indeed useful when you take the time to stop and use them, but it hasn't brought about as significant effects as they did in the book. I didn't expect them to, as I'm not a surgeon performing, well, surgery, or anything as drastic for the matter.\n\nHowever, this book did teach me one thing - something I've more derived from contemplation of the book itself. The point I've taken is to slow down in the things that I do, especially things that require a lot of thought due to their complexity. As a college student, I'm constantly faced with exams and questions that I need to blaze through, but taking the time to stop and think about each question has definitely improved my performance in these areas. I rarely, if ever, trip over those trick questions that are littered throughout my exams, as I've taken the time to thoroughly think through them. Is this reaction actually exothermic, or does it appear so because of the solution its in?\n\nThis is definitely a book I'd share with a friend. In fact, another college friend of mine is currently reading my copy of the book and she too has started taking things a little slower [and benefiting].

To my surprise The Checklist Manifesto was NOT a self help book on productivity, which is what I was expecting from the title. On the contrary, the book was a fascinating, hard to put down narrative investigation on how checklists can save us from catastrophic disasters in our decision making.\n\nAtul Gawande is of course a famous surgeon, and he centers the book on his work to create a checklist for the World Health Organization (WHO) to help diminish problems that arise in the surgery room. Gawande takes us to Boeing where we learn about the check list pilots use before flight, as well as during a crash. We also learn about the need for checklists in the surgery room and why they're necessary. But perhaps most insightful was the social element of implementing checklists and our reticence to utilize them despite they're benefits.\n\nWhile I would not characterize this book as a \"self help\" book that I expected it to be, it has turned out to effectively be an actual help in my life. When confronting a poorly organized work event, myself and another person who happened to also read Checklist Manifesto set out to create a checklist that would address all the issues that happened at work.\n\nSo whether you are interested in an engaging story, or you want to be able to solve complex problems in your own life, I highly recommend reading Atul Gawande's The Checklist Manifesto!"}, "R1ZAYI15WJ9TFQ": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZAYI15WJ9TFQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on April 4, 2015", "text": "I've always made my own check lists, even at home.

Significant life savings, dollar savings, complications/after-effect improvement (quality improvements)...results from Michigan and from around the world. All three results achieved from the same activity.\n\nI noticed that most of the 3-or-below reviewers cited a lack of 'how,' and that many of the positive reviewers commented on this as well. For those concerned about 'how:'\n\nI see the 'how' as implicit in several of Gawande's anecdotes. To cite just one: the hypothermia/drowning victim (pps. 15-19).\n\nIn order to achieve this stunning result--reviving a child 'dead' for 90 minutes--the Austrian medical team had to reach beyond the traditional definition to 'all-related-members:' the search/rescue, emergency medical technician as well as a broad collection of physician, surgeon and nurse specialists. In order to effect the 'rescue,' they needed to front-load as many life-saving techniques as possible--many of them implemented as soon as the victim's discovery, many carried out en route to the hospital. All the hospital specialists were notified and assembled while the child was en route. They were on hand and prepared when she arrived.\n\nAlso, they used what I'd call 'simultaneous medicine,' implementing the medical countermeasures in parallel where possible, or in unusually rapid succession.\n\nTo pull this all together, they surely had to have extensive exchange of information across the work-roles. I expect they continue to discover ways to improve the odds of survival, by iterating through these activities:\n\n(1) pull together 'all-related-members'\n(2) front-load activity\n(3) use simultaneous activity where possible\n(4) exchange information and collaborate across the specialties\n(5) improve, improve, improve\n\nI find gems too numerous to mention in this book. Dr. Gawande observes, for instance, that checklists are 'simple' and yet have incredible impact. Yes, simple but not easy.\n\nCreating checking mechanisms requires making tacit knowledge (stored in the 'silo' of individual or team expertitise) into explicit knowledge which can be understood and applied across all-related-members. This can be difficult because individuals don't always understand the benefit of sharing--or are afraid or threatened.\n\nDr. Gawande asks the multi-billion dollar question on p. 161: can medical culture seize the opportunity represented by these checklist activities?\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, there are anecdotes across many industries. I highly recommend the book, and recommend that readers reflect deeply on its implication for their own work and output, whatever their profession or industry."}, "R3VRW5FMN1UCLQ": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VRW5FMN1UCLQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "4.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on February 18, 2013", "text": "Intellectual arrogance is not uncommon for many people when they are expert at their job.

The stories from the emergency room are extremely compelling - the last three pages had my own heart throbbing. And while the book does have many case studies and operating room anecdotes, Gawande smoothly teases out the challenges that exist for any organization experimenting with new technology or procedures and lightly discusses the surrounding philosophy. The idea of a checklist is difficult to discuss without providing lots of social context.\n\nThat checklists are relatively new to medicine might explain why the book is written so optimistically and enthusiastically about other fields that use checklists. However, it has to be remembered that, especially in aviation, checklists are only really good at preventing things that have already happened. Talk of variances and 'chaos' in complex systems does come up in several places but Gawande doesn't quite connect the dots or talk about how a post-checklist-implementation world might cope. Elaborating on checklists' weaknesses and opportunities for the tool to move even deeper into organizations (for organizational decision makers, perhaps) would make for a great sequel.\n\nIf you are even peripherally interested or involved with systems thinking and complexity, The Checklist Manifesto will feel very familiar. Near the end, the author quotes medicine systems expert Donald Berwick: \"Anyone who understands systems will know immediately that optimizing parts is not a good route to system excellence.\" If the connection isn't immediately clear I suggest you buy the book and read it.

When translated, KISS stands for \"keep it short and simple.\" There are few authors today that are willing to tell the truth and be objective, while still maintaining credibility. I would like to address Atul Gawande's most recent entry and classic, \"The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right.\"\n\nGawande is also the author of Better and Complications, a general and endocrine surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, a staff writer for The New Yorker, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health, and leads the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. Quite an impressive resume Mr. Gawande has there; however, his ego never gets to him. His \"down-to-earth\" approach to the implementation of checklists is wholly inspirational. In The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande attempts to redefine society's mentality through his ability to write cleverly and eloquently while being objective and straight to the point. He supports his in-depth research and provides a variety of careers and fields where a simple checklist can be implemented. In fact, it works.\n\nGawande establishes his cleverness and objectiveness early in the The Checklist Manifesto. He talks about a true story of how an anesthesiologist used the wrong concentration of potassium that he'd intended. In fact, the anesthesiologist used \"a concentration one hundred times higher\" (Gawande 6). The team did everything they could to try to stabilize the patient: \"The surgical team was so shaken they weren't sure they could finish the operation. They'd not only nearly killed the man but also failed to recognize how. They did finish the procedure though\" (Gawande 7). Now, you may be sitting there thinking \"Why would it matter if they made a mistake? As long as the surgical team was able to save the patient, then it shouldn't matter, right?\" Let me ask you this question: \"Are we to rely on luck over and over again?\" This was just one patient and a simple mistake almost killed the patient. By spending a few seconds (or even minutes) looking over and using a checklist, you can substantially minimize potential mistakes. Gawande also tells the reader of an instance in aviation where a Delta Air Lines flight from Shanghai to Atlanta with 247 people aboard almost crashed on November 26, 2008. The engine failed because of icy conditions. The pilot and copilot \"got out their checklist and followed the lessons it offered\" (Gawande 135). Because of what they did, the engine recovered and all 247 people were saved.\n\n\"If you were having an operation, would you want the checklist to be used? A full 93 percent said yes\" (Gawande 157). This was a survey taken by medical professionals. Gawande is consistent in being clever throughout The Checklist Manifesto and never loses his focus on the importance of checklists. Gawande is able to capture medicine in all of its complex and chaotic glory. He inspires all of us, doctor or not, to lose our ego, implement a simple checklist, and be better. Less is more. Keep it simple.\n\nI highly recommend The Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande to any reader because it can apply to the lives of just about anyone.\n\nGene"}, "R3ME0C83WHM2XA": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3ME0C83WHM2XA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "3.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on August 15, 2017", "text": "Good read about the importance of Check Lists.

Another indicator: I read the book slowly, tasty morsel by tasty morsel. Lastly, there's serious emotion when I turn the last page--somehow hoping it could go on and on. This book scores 10s on all counts.\n\nReally? A book about checklists is that good? Yes. If you enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The Story of Success, you'll love this one.\n\n[x] 1. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and staff writer for The New Yorker, leads the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. If you didn't believe in checklists before, you'll be a born-again checklist-maker after Chapter 1.\n\n[x] 2. He quotes a 1970s study on \"necessary fallibility.\" It cites two reasons we fail at stuff: a) ignorance and b) ineptitude. In the latter, \"...the knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly.\"\n\n[x] 3. Caution! If you're having surgery soon, or have friends or family facing the knife, you may want to skip this book--or ask your surgeon's views on operating room checklists. (In a recent global experiment, a two-minute pre-surgery team review of a standard checklist has dropped infection rates, death rates and complication rates by a staggering amount.)\n\n[x] 4. Pilots have long been the checklist gurus--but the art and science of well-crafted checklists have not found favor in other professions or industries...yet. The Captain Sully story, though expected, still caused my heart to beat fast. You'll appreciate how checklists saved the day for the \"Miracle on the Hudson.\"\n\n[x] 5. The chapter, \"The End of the Master Builder,\" takes you into the elite world of checklists created under the hardhats of McNamara/Salvia, a Boston high rise construction firm. The dingy construction trailer is long gone. In its place, \"...on the walls around a big white oval table, hung sheets of butcher-block-size printouts of what were, to my surprise, checklists.\"\n\n[x] 6. Checklists are \"ridiculously simple.\" What seems obvious, isn't. Checklists enhance teamwork--even among virtuoso surgeons. \"There's a reason much of the world uses the phrase, operating theater.\"\n\n[x] 7. Boeing's checklist expert uses \"pause points\" when building checklists for pilots in crisis. Within each pause point, he limits the checklist to between five and nine items. I had no idea that there were checklist connoisseurs.\n\n[x] 8. For crisis lists, decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist (do what your gut tells you, then go back and confirm you did it) or a READ-DO checklist (more like a recipe).\n\n[x] 9. Gawande interviewed the managing partner of a California investment firm who is a checklist zealot. He cited the \"cocaine brain\" that researchers often experience when investigating company financial reports. Without a thorough checklist (honed over years of experience), a greed mode kicks in and wipes out thoughtful discernment. They use a \"Day Three Checklist\" to avoid disasters. \"Forty-nine times out of fifty, he said, there's nothing to be found. `But then there is.'\"\n\n[x] 10. \"Fly the airplane,\" amazingly, is the first item on a checklist for engine failure on a single-engine Cessna airplane. \"Because pilots sometimes become so desperate trying to restart their engine, so crushed by the cognitive overload of thinking through what could have gone wrong, they forget this most basic task. FLY THE AIRPLANE.\"\n\nIn one study of 250 staff members (surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and others), 80 percent reported that the new checklist had improved the safety of care and 78 percent \"actually observed the checklist to have prevented an error in the operating room.\" Yet, 20 percent gave it a thumbs down.\n\nThen Gawande asked one more question, \"If you were having an operation, would you want the checklist to be used?\" A full 93 percent said yes!"}, "RR5WSP2RNURD0": {"review_url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR5WSP2RNURD0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805091742", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "on April 14, 2015", "text": "There are many books about management techniques but this one explains steps to process improvement which work.

I've been there,\" he seems to say; \"but I saw this applied and I tried it myself and it works.\" This is for the best - otherwise, the book would have been preachy and likely a flop. Instead, it comes across as a powerful case for the checklist, a practice whose adoption, while slow and often troubled, seems to bring extraordinary results.\n\nMr. Gawande's point of departure is medicine - he is a surgeon - but his cases and examples come from aviation, construction, and finance. Combined, they show checklists, which ensure basic questions are asked before or during a task, yield a significant improvement in outcomes: Flights stay in the air or land safely, buildings stay erect, investments are sounder, and patients live.\n\nThe case for the checklist ultimately comes from its results, but Mr. Gawande makes more than an \"it works\" argument for it. Tasks are increasingly complex while professionals are fallible - it is no shame to admit that in tough situations, people can cut corners or get so overwhelmed they forget to perform basic tasks or ask basic questions. Professionalism without discipline is no good, Mr. Gawande, seems to say - or at, can be much better with discipline.
