Vance excels in crafting a cohesive narrative rather than an argument -- though the book achieves both functions -- and its intensely personal nature removes any perception of political positioning, despite specific statements revealing political leanings. <br/><br/>I read this during one caffeine-fueled focus binge, revealing both the book's inherent readability and optimal length as well as the extent to which reading is tearing my schedule apart in a dubiously beneficial process of cathartic sleep deprivation. <br/><br/>Read this book; you will not regret it.",,,2,,,0,,,,,

I get that it served as a dystopian/utopian metaphorical warning for the horrors of life in a ""perfect"" society. I get that it is eighty years old and therefore I should temper my expectations for its diction. <br/><br/>That being said, Bernard Marx is a terrible main character who easily abandons his principles; Helmholtz Watson, supposed confidant and comrade to Marx, uselessly prattles about art, doesn't act like a real person, but suddenly joins the Savage in his ""heroic"" final action; John the Savage, a supposed foil for what modern civilization has become, isn't introduced until halfway through. The universal love interest adds nothing to the story. <br/><br/>I must add that my favorite character/the only character I like is Mustapha Mond, World Controller and, like Marx, hypocritical abandoner of principles who rules over a world he initially sought to transcend and which he had the opportunity to leave. I like him because his John Galt-esque speech was the only part of the story that actually contained any gripping story. I understood his character. His choices, which I detest, make sense in the context of his role in society. I hate him, but I appreciate his presence. Other than him, though, the characters and plot never approach the completeness of the themes they develop.<br/><br/>Maybe this is the point of the story: as the reader I SHOULD hate the characters. Maybe the half-formed heroes, the well-conditioned love interest, the painful social sensitivity, the success of the society's conditioning are deliberate casualties of the real message -- that fully embracing modern industrial production a la Henry Ford (excellent replacement of f*** with Ford) leads to false happiness, libertine sexual values, the destruction of the family, blatant social stratification by GMO human production and behavioural conditioning -- and thus maybe I should try harder to appreciate them. <br/><br/>In that frame, there exists irony in my hating the story -- the characters, plot, etc. -- strictly BECAUSE the underlying thesis is successful. <br/><br/>However, the frame through which I read any book requires those factors to be as well-formed as the themes. Therefore I disliked reading this partially-finished, seemingly unedited alarmist bile that lacked any sort of literary depth. <br/><br/>Sue me.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

What he describes does have strong implications in the present, of course, but to make them a point of focus in the book would have been very distracting for the reader and would have muddled the book's thesis.

The characters, settings, and plotlines pulled me in and kept me coming back for more. The philosophy behind it was my favorite aspect, however, and was the reason I read the book in the first place. <br/>During the first half of the book, I thought, ""Wow! Objectivism is a great philosophy that emphasizes personal effort and maximum return on effort! And you have to be honest with yourself about everything and ponder the reasons you do things and not uphold stupid societal strictures if you don't believe in them!""<br/>And then in the second half of the book, I thought, ""Wow! None of objectivism's representative heroes have the ability to feel anything, unless they are together reveling in each other's selfishness! This philosophy fails to recognize the personal return to charity, and is more anarcho-capitalism than individualism!""<br/>Basically I got sick of having people defined as binary, having every heroic moment accompanied by a lack of emotion, having women unable to enjoy relationships unless they feel like a male's sex servant, and of philosophers entirely abandoning those who don't perfectly share their belief.<br/>The story admittedly jumps randomly to new focuses (e.g. finding the engine, the hobo on the train working at 20th Century, being close to an airport when the train gets stuck) and the discontinuity gets a bit old. Some characters exist only to emphasize a belief without necessarily being important to the story (Cheryl, Stadler). Galt's radio speech was pretty incomprehensible, and I had a hard time focusing on it.<br/><br/>But overlooking those obvious flaws, I did enjoy this book. A lot. It combines my love of philosophy, books, and controversial ideas in a very good package. But I can't let the story's discontinuity and repetitive characterizations get by without a star deduction.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

In two hours surrounding a delicious  breakfast of eggs, chicken, a bagel, and a spinach shake, I experienced true and deep catharsis. <br/><br/>The stark prose and ambiguity surrounding every character, setting and plot development left room for me as the reader to project my own emotions and experiences onto the story and especially onto the main character. I felt, viscerally, both the optimistic joy of success and the intense longing for lost love. That the story is told from the second-person only reinforces this incredible connection between reader and story.<br/><br/>As a skeptic of all forms of self help, I enjoyed the satirical self-help framework. I also applaud that it fails -- and that the narrator is fully conscious and upfront about that failure. <br/><br/>I don't cry often, and never due to books or movies. But at the end, which arrived far too soon, I cried, just absolutely sobbing with wistful happiness at experiencing a full life outside my own -- birth, love, struggle, death -- and it was all very confusing for a young, usually-stoic male raised in a masculinity-crazed society.<br/><br/>I found this book to be exceptional. <br/>10/10, would recommend.<br/><br/>Side note: I read this book based on a recommendation from venture capitalist Chris Sacca in Tim Ferris's podcast. Apparently Sacca assigns it as required reading for startup founders at companies in which he invests. ",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

The book even includes many pictures and maps to emphasize points and serve as examples, enhancing my understanding. <br/>Walker aptly displays why he's a sought-after transit consultant. <br/>Refreshingly, he takes the viewpoint of an economist on transit planning: there is no good nor bad, just tradeoffs. Rather than present options as being one of opposite extremes, he describes each tradeoff as some point between the two extremes, on a spectrum. <br/>Walker repeatedly emphasizes that the goal of the transit (some combination of Ridership or Coverage) creates the basis for planning; this helps remove all the typical ""I'm successful, I'm the author, my way is best"" egoism that plagues some similar books. <br/>Overall, a concise guide to transit planning and relevant for anyone interested in the subject at any level.

Nonetheless, most descriptions are absolutely touching, especially patients' stories and the descriptions of the challenges doctors face in attempting to remain objective. <br/>Perhaps my favorite sections describe the overwhelming responsibility doctors are expected to take in stride and how frustrated and jaded they become faced with such unreasonable expectations. I've experienced this secondhand watching my dad struggle with a crazy amount of work and stress in the name of providing the best possible care for his patients. I also really  enjoyed Ofri's commentary regarding and analysis of the effects of America's bloated administrative and malpractice culture within medicine and its effects on patient care and rising costs.<br/>Ofri stays true to her title and subtitle the entire book -- a rarity among today's nonfiction output. <br/>Overall, I deeply enjoyed reading this book, and wish my pre-med friends the best of luck (eek).

I felt that he beat the dead horse with personality descriptions of Amos and Danny without offering enough substance into their research and how those findings have affected the world. <br/>I realize that this book is supposed to be a story of the two individuals, and it does okay in this regard. However, I really feel that Lewis doesn't do enough to substantiate the pair's impact.<br/>This may be because I've read Kahneman's excellent Thinking, Fast and Slow, as well as a lot of other material describing their impact. But the feeling remains, and I'm left feeling a bit incomplete.<br/>Major props to Lewis, however, for remaining objective much of his analysis and storytelling -- he does not portray Amos or Danny as perfect heroes or anything.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The author does a good job of highlighting specific struggles that students face in top tier schools.

As a budding economist, I found it hard to swallow the idea, that competition is bad for both business and consumers, that drives so much of the rhetoric about the benefits of monopolization. Fortunately, I recognize the business sense behind it: more competition = lower profit, almost universally.

I love the ""Beg for forgiveness, don't ask permission"" mentality and use it quite often. I think that things such as freeing yourself from office presence, justifying work for its own sake, and proposing solutions instead of asking for them are great ideas. <br/>What I don't like about this book are the borderline unethical methods suggested to accomplish such things. You can do all those things without the amount of deception and irrational risk-taking that Ferriss suggests. Also, he makes building a $10,000+/month ""muse"" business sound really easy and fast. It's simply not. Ideas are hard to come by. Really hard.

I really did. You display a masterful ability to convey the complicated emotional dynamics of a really weird eighteenth-century social group of dramatic Russian aristocrats. Your writing makes scenes and characters come alive in my mind. I never could have thought that Russia would have been so exciting all the time. However, [and Fyodor, don't take this the wrong way] your book didn't really grab hold of me. It didn't pull me in to the point where I put it down with great remorse. The characters were exciting and you made them come to life, but there didn't really seem to be any point to any of the things that they were doing. You conjured one mindless drama after another, and portrayed poor Myshkin as an idiot. Fyodor, Myshkin doesn't belong in your book at all! He is arguably the perfect man (though admittedly somewhat confused love-struck, and prone to anxiety attacks and illogical decisions). He is a shining pearl tossed about in a sea of dishonest, unstable, manipulative, and ungracious alcoholics. The problem is, you gave all those other characters too much sway in the plot. Myshkin needed to be a hero and achieve some great emotional victory and marry Aglaia (before she went completely crazy) and go live up in the mountains where the sun always shines! Instead, you just left him to fight off the pointless dramas that the other characters constantly managed to involve themselves in. I cannot say that I did not enjoy reading you book, Fyodor. But you just wrote the wrong one. ",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

Gay relates both those topics to literature,  film, current events, and popular culture with provocative and surprisingly accessible style. I agree with much of what she says, and appreciate her perspectives on misogyny, race in the media, and reproductive rights (negotiability of the female body). I disliked three of the essays that didn't quite make sense to me and/or were too inflammatory in their arguments. Overall, though, Gay's unique style and perspective makes for a great book.

It is comical and educational, yet sobering and simultaneously informative. It is basically a  modern take on how to build a free society, but also explores human nature, historical tragedies, and especially the ridiculousness of medieval politics and the glorification of the Knights of the Round Table. With clever wit and skilled sotrytelling throughout, I'd say this book is Twain's best work and a must-read.",,,1,,,1,,,unspecified,,

While it does a very good job at expressing the inequality of America's school system in poor urban areas as compared to wealthier suburbs, it fails to elaborate prescriptively except to endlessly drone on about money. Kozol basically posits that throwing money at a poor school will make it better. He also describes the school system as purposefully racist and segregated. He never mentions that schools are served by the people living around it; of course people living living in an extremely poor town are going to be poor and uneducated. He does recognize that property tax as a means to fund schools is wrong, and says that federal funding should replace it. However, the entire book essentially repeats itself; the only thing that ever changes is the location. After reading the book, I'm left feeling more aware of problems in inner city schools, but don't feel like i've gained anything else by reading it. Very disappointing book for me.

Johnson spins an intricate web of Gladwell-esque narrative proportion, but without making it so easy to read that one becomes bored. Most of the ideas put forth are excellent, though there are a couple that could be considered somewhat redundant. The concepts of liquid networks, the adjacent possible, and exaptation are all intriguing and very intuitive. Luckily, it's not a dumbed-down self-help book; it simply presents patterns that assist in the creation and application of world-changing ideas.
